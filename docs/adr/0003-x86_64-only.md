# ADR 0003: x86_64-Only Target for Current Epochs

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Oxide is an operating system under active architectural development.
The project is currently focused on establishing core system invariants,
including:

- Loader to kernel separation
- Firmware exit and hardware ownership
- Memory discovery and ownership
- Early execution and debugging primitives

At this stage, these invariants are being designed, implemented, and validated
on a single architecture: **x86_64**.

Supporting additional architectures (e.g., ARM64) would require fundamentally
different implementations for:
- Boot flow and early execution environment
- MMU configuration and page table formats
- Exception and interrupt models
- Memory ordering guarantees
- Platform discovery mechanisms

Attempting to abstract across architectures before these invariants are proven
would introduce unnecessary complexity, premature indirection, and unclear
ownership boundaries.

## Decision

Oxide will target **x86_64 exclusively for the current architectural epochs**.

This is a **scope decision**, not an ideological commitment. The choice reflects
the need to:
- Validate core system design on a concrete, well-understood platform
- Avoid premature portability abstractions
- Keep early development focused and debuggable

No guarantees are made regarding multi-architecture support during these epochs.

## Consequences

- Architecture-specific assumptions (x86_64 paging, exception model, interrupts)
  are permitted during current development.
- The codebase may freely use x86_64-specific mechanisms where appropriate.
- Supporting another architecture would be treated as a **new architectural
  epoch**, not an incremental feature.
- Documentation and ADRs should reflect x86_64 assumptions explicitly.

This decision reduces short-term complexity and increases the likelihood that
the core architecture stabilizes correctly.

## Future Considerations

Oxide is not philosophically limited to x86_64.

If and when the project’s core invariants are stable, additional architectures
may be evaluated. Any such effort would:
- Begin as a distinct epoch
- Re-examine loader, kernel, and handoff boundaries
- Introduce architecture-specific implementations behind clearly defined
  interfaces

Portability will be addressed only after correctness, clarity, and ownership
are established on the initial target platform.
